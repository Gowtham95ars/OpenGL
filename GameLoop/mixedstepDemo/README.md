Sample sphere rotation using the mixedstep gameloop code.  
Usage:  
Right Click to select target framerate (default 30)  
The no-cap option simply increases framerate and does not affect the gamestate update, if you want you can place update() within the if statement to force physics update along with it.  
In order for the no-cap version to work disable vsync or similar settings in the nvidia control panel or equivalent driver software.  
Use Fraps on windows or glxosd on linux to measure framerate.
